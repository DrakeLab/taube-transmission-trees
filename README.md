Summary:
Public health investigations often aim to identify who infected whom, or the transmission tree, during outbreaks of infectious diseases. These investigations tend to be resource intensive but valuable as they contain epidemiological information, including the average number of infections caused by each individual and the variation in this number. To date, there remains no standarized format nor comphrehensive database of infectious disease transmission trees. To fill this gap, we standardized and compiled more than 350 published transmission trees for 16 directly-transmitted diseases into a database that is publicly available. Here, we demonstrate the types of questions that the database can be used to answer related to superspreader frequency, timing, and generation. In the future, this database can be used to answer other outstanding questions in the field of epidemiology.

Contents:
dashboard.Rmd: code for OutbreakTrees.ecology.uga.edu website where anyone can access trees and download them for use
analysis.Rmd: code for tree analysis, including several sample analyses

Instructions to reproduce results:
To reproduce results, run the analysis.Rmd file. This file has already compiled the trees and will complete key calculations and produce the relevant figures.
